# Fahrradstellplätze Berlin
Experimental single purpose editor for bike parking in Berlin http://wwwfiles.de/fahrradstellplaetze/, based on discussions in the [Berlin OpenStreetMap meetup](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Talk:Berlin/Verkehrswende/Fahrradparkplaetze).
Seeded and developed during the [DB Open-Data-Hackathon Summercamp 2019](https://dbmindbox.com/en/db-opendata-hackathons/hackathons/db-open-data-hackathon-community-summercamp-juli-2019/).

*Note: The code for this project can be found over at [@tordans fork](https://github.com/tordans/id) of the official [iD OpenStreetMap editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/id).*

## Single Purpose Editors

Several topics out of the OpenStreetMap ecosystem have massively grown in complexity and hence became harder and harder to map, especially for the casual mapper or even mapping beginners in order to bring domain soecific knowledge in public databases like OpenStreetMap. To test the waters for a more focused mapping we tried to implement a single purpose editor. After trying different editors or even writing a completely new interface we opted for altering the web editor of OpenStreetMap - iD. As a result we compiled a list of GitHub issues to possible improve single-porpuse editors like this one in the future.

## `data/`

We compiled a few snapshots of the current state of mapping bike infrastructure in [Berlin](https://wikidata.org/wiki/Q64) in our [presentation](https://slides.com/n0rdlicht/deck#/), also to be found in `presentation/`.
